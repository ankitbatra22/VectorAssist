# VectorAssist
In this project, I used computer vision to take an input picture of two written down vectors, and accurately classify each of the numbers to calculate the dot and cross product of the vectors. I trained the model using the MNIST dataset, and openCV to create contours, the bounding boxes and apply a Gaussian filter.

The test image, and results can be seen in the Results Folder.
